Novus Partners Inc Software Architect 2013-10-01 to 2014-06-30
As head of Front End Development at Novus Partners, I lead a team of four developers in a complete front-end rewrite. Our previous platform was a brittle Scala Server Pages implementation. After releasing this rewrite, our slick & fast AngularJS frontend has become decoupled from the Scala backend, allowing both services to become much more focused and performant. We also build and maintain the NVD3 open-source charting library. I have led an ongoing effort to refactor the original prototype codebase into a maintainable, extensible, and testable library that will serve front-end charting for years to come.

Responsible for the entire technology stack at a start-up software development company. Accomplishments include developing several platforms to facilitate web programing, implementing a continuous integration server across several languages and frameworks, and architecting several medium-scale projects with a team of five developers and designers.

Our largest project was a field agent tracking system, responsible for maintaining scheduling and routing information for hundreds of in-store field marketing agents in Australia. The project combined a variety of technologies, including a scalable PHP backend, dynamic mobile frontend, and extensive reporting capabilities.

In the course of the project, we developed JEFRi, a Javascript Entity Framework to facilitate our mobile development work.

Technical Whiteboarding 2023-04-01

A series of posts on how to approach technical whiteboarding. Technical whiteboarding is often encountered in an interview setting, but the techniques to solve an interview question apply equally well to a wide range of design and development scenarios. This several-part series presents a checklist of steps to work through a technical problem, shows a variety of ways to diagram programs, and has an extensive glossary of data structures & algorithms topics. A section on the "Forward/Backward Method" applies mathematical proof techniques to have a systematic approach to DS&A problem solving.
Visualization by Organizing Connections in Collapsible Hierarchical Graphs 2019-06-01

Abstract Network graphs in certain applications, e.g., cloud-network graphs, have connections in multiple dimensions. At present, it is difficult or inconvenient for a user to visualize such graphs at varying levels of granularity or hierarchy. Per the techniques of this disclosure, a hull is defined as a node with descendants, and a segment is defined as a bundle of edges between descendants below a pair of nodes. By enabling a user to expand or collapse a hull, and by routing edges via segments connecting parent nodes, the described techniques enable a high-level visualization of large graph networks that can be quickly refocused into low-level pictures.
