  Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description
  Our own experiences of pain are better known to us than the bio-chemical structure of our brains. Some philosophers hold that this difference is due to different kinds of knowledge: knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. I have first-hand or direct knowledge of my own experiences; whereas I have only second-hand or indirect knowledge of my brain’s being in a particular bio-chemical state. These two different kinds of knowledge indicate an essential difference in one’s awareness of certain kinds of truths. There is, however, considerable controversy among philosophers whether this distinction can consistently be applied and whether generally knowledge by acquaintance offers a stronger or better perspective on one’s knowledge than other kinds of knowledge.

  Some philosophers distinguish knowledge by acquaintance from knowledge by description roughly along the following lines: knowledge by acquaintance is a unique form of knowledge where the subject has direct, unmediated, and non-inferential access to what is known whereas knowledge by description is a type of knowledge that is indirect, mediated, and inferential. There are some significant philosophical issues in spelling out how exactly to make this distinction and even whether it is possible to maintain that there is a privileged kind of knowledge by acquaintance. Nonetheless, many philosophers have put this distinction to work in issues related to epistemology and philosophy of mind.

  1. The Distinction: Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description

  The concept of acquaintance was introduced to contemporary philosophy by Bertrand Russell in his seminal article “Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description” (1910) and in chapter five of The Problems of Philosophy (1912) (although see Russell 1905, pp. 479-480, 492-493 for an earlier passing discussion of it). Russell explains that a person is acquainted with an object when he stands in a “direct cognitive relation to the object, i.e. when [the subject is] directly aware of the object itself” (Russell 1910, p. 108). In another place, he writes “we have acquaintance with anything of which we are directly aware, without the intermediary of any process of inference or any knowledge of truths” (Russell 1912, p. 46). To have knowledge by acquaintance, according to Russell, occurs when the subject has an immediate or unmediated awareness of some propositional truth. Knowledge by description, by contrast, is propositional knowledge that is inferential, mediated, or indirect.

  The traditional account of knowledge by acquaintance is susceptible to being misunderstood or conflated with merely being directly acquainted with something (on this point see Russell 1914, p. 151). It is important to notice that there is a difference between being directly acquainted with something and having knowledge by acquaintance that something is the case. For a subject to be directly acquainted with something only requires for the subject to have unmediated access to the object of awareness.  Knowledge by acquaintance that something is the case, however, is more than being directly acquainted with something’s being the case. Knowledge by acquaintance, after all, is a kind of knowledge, which requires the subject to hold a belief under the right conditions. For a subject to be directly acquainted with something does not necessarily require the subject to hold a belief about it. Notice the difference in the following claims:

  (1) S is directly acquainted with p

  and

  (2) S knows by direct acquaintance that p.

  Propositions (1) and (2) do not mean the same thing. The truth-conditions for (1) are different than the truth-conditions for (2). In order for (1) to be true, it needs to be the case that the subject is in fact acquainted with p. For example, when p is the fact that one is experiencing a mild pain, all it takes for (1) to be true is that the subject has some unmediated access or awareness of his pain experience.  However, for (2) to be true, more is required. Some person may be directly acquainted with his mild pain experience but fail to have knowledge that he is having a pain experience, perhaps by failing to attend to this experience in such a way that he forms a propositional belief on the basis of his direct acquaintance with the pain experience. (Consider the possibility of an animal–perhaps a fish or a worm–that has the capacity to be acquainted with its pains, but lacks the capacity to form any propositional attitudes.) Thus, (1) may be a necessary condition for (2), but it would be hasty to conclude that (1) is sufficient for (2) or that (1) and (2) are equivalent. The subject needs to be aware of no propositional content about p to satisfy (1). But in order to satisfy (2), the subject needs to have a belief with propositional content about p, which is properly based on his direct acquaintance with p.

  2. The Epistemology of Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description

  The epistemological issues involving the distinction, knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description, have focused primarily on whether there is privileged unmediated knowledge by acquaintance. I begin with Russell’s epistemic use of the distinction, and then I will survey some contemporary accounts of knowledge by acquaintance. Finally, to round out this overview of the epistemic applications of this distinction I will highlight a couple of criticisms of classical accounts of knowledge by acquaintance and responses to them.

  a. Bertrand Russell

  Russell used the distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and description to articulate a foundationalist epistemology where knowledge by acquaintance is the most basic kind of knowledge and knowledge by description is inferential (Russell 1910 and 1912, ch. 5). “All our knowledge,” wrote Russell, “rests upon acquaintance for its foundation” (Russell 1912, p. 48). Knowledge by acquaintance, therefore, is a direct kind of knowledge; it is a kind of knowledge that does not depend on inference or mediation. The test Russell employs for determining what someone knows by acquaintance is based on dubitability. For this reason, Russell maintained a person cannot know by acquaintance that physical objects, like an iPod, exist; after all, even when someone is seeing an iPod, it is possible to doubt whether the iPod exists (due to the possibilities of dreaming, illusion, hallucination, and so forth). The sense data, or sensory experiences, of an iPod, however, cannot consistently be doubted by a person who is experiencing them. Thus, sense data can be known by acquaintance, whereas physical objects cannot.  Russell also believed that one could be directly acquainted with memory experiences, introspective experiences (awareness of one’s own direct acquaintances and other internal sensations), universals, and (probably) even one’s own self (see Russell 1912, ch. 5; however, for one place where he is less confident of being directly acquainted with the self, see his 1914, p. 81).

  On Russell’s view one cannot know by acquaintance that physical objects exist. Consequently, knowledge by description provides the only possibility of knowing physical objects. Knowledge by description, according to Russell, is dependent on direct acquaintance in at least two ways. First, knowledge by description depends on acquaintance for its propositional content. Russell unequivocally stated, “every proposition which we can understand must be composed wholly of constituents with which we are acquainted” (Russell 1912, p. 58). Although one’s knowledge by description may concern objects that outstrip the range of one’s immediate acquaintance, the propositional content is composed of concepts with which the subject is directly acquainted.

  There is a similarity between the way one can know something about particular things outside of one’s experience and the way Russell envisioned knowledge by description to allow a person to think about physical objects. Consider the belief that the tallest living man in the world exists. Someone can form this belief, even though he may have no clue who this individual is. Understanding the concepts of being the tallest, being alive, and being a man are sufficient for allowing a person to hold this belief, even though its referent may lie beyond the set of people that one has met first-hand. Likewise, Russell believed that one could form beliefs about physical objects, despite the fact that one cannot ever be directly acquainted with them. When a person holds the belief, for example, that there is a cup of coffee, he is not directly acquainted with the coffee as a physical object, but he is able to think about the physical object through descriptions with which he is directly acquainted. The descriptive content might consist of there being an object that is the cause of his experiences of blackness, bitterness, hotness, and liquidness. On Russell’s account, the subject’s acquaintance with the right concepts allows him to form beliefs about physical objects.

  The second way in which knowledge by description depends on acquaintance is that knowledge by description is inferentially dependent on knowledge by acquaintance. In other words, the propositions one knows by description ultimately are inferred from one’s propositional knowledge by acquaintance. Consequently, this gives rise to a foundationalist epistemology in which all of one’s knowledge is either foundational or inferentially based on foundational knowledge. It is well-known that Russell believed one’s knowledge of the world beyond his or her own mind needed to be inferred from more basic knowledge of one’s own mental experiences (see Russell 1912, ch. 2 and Russell 1914). This raises the difficulty for Russell’s position of how to provide a plausible account of this inferential relationship between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description in a way that successfully accommodates the commonsense notion that most people know that physical objects exist.

  b. Recent Accounts

  Since Russell, much work has been advanced in his name promoting and applying the distinction of knowledge by acquaintance and description to use in epistemology. On the one hand, there have been traditional acquaintance theorists who have more-or-less kept the original Russellian conception of knowledge by acquaintance; namely the view that one is directly acquainted with one’s own states of mind and not the extra-mental world. Brie Gertler helpfully characterizes contemporary accounts of knowledge by acquaintance as involving judgments that are (a) tied directly to their truthmakers, (b) depend only on the subject’s conscious states of mind for their justification, and (c) are more strongly justified than any empirical judgments that are not directly tied to their truthmakers and dependent only on conscious states of mind for their justification (Gertler 2012, p. 99). The traditional position on knowledge by acquaintance has been most influentially promulgated by the works of Richard Fumerton and Laurence BonJour (for other accounts related to the traditional approach see Balog 2012, Chalmers 2003, Fales 1996, Feldman 2004, Gertler 2001, Gertler 2011, Gertler 2012, Hasan forthcoming, and Pitt 2004).

  Fumerton has proposed the following three conditions as necessary and sufficient for knowledge by acquaintance: (i) S is directly acquainted with the fact that p; (ii) S is directly acquainted with the thought that p; and (iii) S is directly acquainted with the correspondence that holds between the fact that p and the thought that p (Fumerton 1995, pp. 73-79). These three acquaintances parallel the requirements for a proposition’s being true (on a correspondence theory of truth): (a) the truth-maker (S is directly acquainted with the fact that p); (b) the truth-bearer (S is directly acquainted with the thought that p); and (c) the correspondence relation (S is directly acquainted with the correspondence between the fact that p and the thought that p). Given the subject’s direct acquaintance with (i), (ii), and (iii), he is directly acquainted with everything necessary to constitute being directly acquainted with a true proposition.

  To the extent that BonJour provides an account of knowledge by acquaintance, it is directed exclusively to basic empirical beliefs. BonJour describes his theory of basic empirical justification as taking place when a person directly apprehends that his experience fits or satisfies the description offered by the content of his belief (BonJour 2001; BonJour 2003, especially pp. 60-76, 191-193; BonJour uses the language of “direct acquaintance” in 2001, while he prefers “direct apprehension” in 2003). It is the subject’s ability to have a direct acquaintance or apprehension of the contents of one’s own conscious experiences and how they fit or satisfy the content of one’s basic beliefs that makes knowledge by acquaintance possible. BonJour stresses, however, that fallibility can occur due to the subject’s misapprehension of one’s experience or failure to see the fit between the experience and the belief.  Despite the possibility of error, he believes that this does not undermine genuine cases when a subject does correctly apprehend the character of experience and sees its fit with one’s basic belief.

  On the other hand, there are non-traditional acquaintance theorists who have modified knowledge by acquaintance in such a way that one can be acquainted with and know physical objects directly (such as Brewer 2011). Another deviation from the Russellian tradition is to maintain that knowledge by acquaintance is a different kind of knowledge than propositional knowledge (Tye 2009, pp. 95-102). On this non-propositional approach to knowledge by acquaintance, there is a sense in which one can be said to know something with which one is acquainted, even though the person does not necessarily have any propositional belief states about the thing that is said to be known by acquaintance.

  c. Criticisms

  Perhaps the most influential problem raised for knowledge by acquaintance is commonly called the problem of the speckled hen (due to Gilbert Ryle as reported by Chisholm 1942). The problem arises by considering the case where someone looks at a hen with exactly 48 speckles on one side. Yet, the perceiver’s experience is not adequate grounds for him to distinguish an experience of a hen with exactly 47 or 49 speckles. Indeed, even if someone were to hold the belief that one’s experience is of a hen with exactly 48 speckles, it would by most standards fail to count as knowledge because the subject could have easily formed a false belief (for example, that the hen has 47 or 49 speckles) on the basis of being acquainted with that very experience (for one way to understand this epistemic principle see “The Safety Condition for Knowledge”). In other words, typically people cannot distinguish between having a visual experience of a 47, 48, or 49 speckled hen. However, if a person is directly acquainted with these experiences and can plausibly satisfy the other conditions required for knowledge by acquaintance, then cases of this sort stand as potential counterexamples to possessing knowledge or justification through direct acquaintance. Given the indiscernibility of the contents of mental states through direct acquaintance, this raises doubts whether one’s justification based on direct acquaintance can offer some unique, privileged state of knowledge. After all, one motivation for accepting knowledge by acquaintance is that the subject’s knowledge of his own mental states may be indubitable, whereas other kinds of knowledge cannot. The problem of the speckled hen challenges the idea that one may fail to have indubitable justification through knowledge by acquaintance because for just about any putative mental state with which one is acquainted, since there may be a different mental state that is virtually indistinguishable from it. It even raises the question whether these closely related states constitute genuinely different experiences for the subject at all.

  The problem of the speckled hen has continued to challenge contemporary accounts of knowledge by acquaintance (see Sosa 2003a, 2003b; Markie 2009; Poston 2010). The challenge, as Sosa puts it, is for the acquaintance theorist to “tell us which sorts of features of our states of consciousness are epistemically effective ones, the ones such that by corresponding to them specifically that our basic beliefs acquire epistemically foundational status” (Sosa 2003, pp. 277-278, similar remarks can be found in Sosa 2003b, p.121). Here the concern is that the acquaintance theorist has no principled way of explaining why one’s acquaintance with a simple mental state (for example, an experience of three black dots against a white background) is able to ground a justified belief, whereas one’s acquaintance with a complex mental state (for example, a hen with 48 speckles) fails to serve as appropriate grounds for a justified belief. The problem is for acquaintance theorists to provide a plausible account of the conditions and limits of knowledge by acquaintance that naturally explains cases like the speckled hen.

  A second influential problem for knowledge by acquaintance is due to Wilfrid Sellars. Sellars (1963) famously critiqued the possibility of acquiring non-inferentially justified beliefs through some privileged, direct relation to one’s sensory experience. The problem that Sellars has raised can be put in terms of a dilemma (for a recent defense of this type of dilemma, see Williams 1999). The dilemma focuses on whether the conscious experiential states of mind are propositional or non-propositional. If, on the one hand, mental experiences are non-propositional, then it is mysterious (at best) to explain how a belief can derive any justification from a non-propositional basis. Donald Davidson expresses the core intuition behind this horn of the dilemma: “nothing can count as a reason for holding a belief except another belief” (1986, p. 126). The central claim at the crux of this side of the dilemma is that only propositional entities can stand in logical or justificatory relations to other propositional entities.

  On the other side of the dilemma, if one accepts that mental experiences are propositional, then the problem for acquaintance theorists is to explain how one is justified in accepting the propositional content of experiences. Defenders of this objection stress that this horn of the dilemma pushes the problem of generating non-inferential justification back a step. If beliefs derive their justification from the propositional contents of experiences, then experiences too must derive their justification from some other appropriate source of propositional content. Contrary to the kind of foundationalism proposed by the acquaintance theorist, this horn of the dilemma essentially states that mental experiences do not constitute a non-arbitrary way to stop the regress of justification needed to arrive at a foundational bedrock for empirical knowledge or justification.

  Thus, the Sellarsian dilemma appears to leave no viable alternative for the defender of direct acquaintance: (i) if experiences are non-propositional, then they cannot stand in justificatory relations to propositional beliefs; (ii) if experiences are propositional, then there must be some further basis for one to be justified in holding the propositional content of the experiences. The first option alleges that deriving justification from non-propositional content is mysterious and inexplicable. The second option alleges that granting propositional content to experiences does not stop the regress of reasons. Either way, the foundational and unique role that is supposed to be filled by knowledge by acquaintance is undermined.

  d. Replies

  In response to the problem of the speckled hen, Fumerton (2005) has suggested a variety of options available to the acquaintance theorist. First, it is possible that knowledge by acquaintance fails in cases like the speckled hen because the subject fails to have an acquaintance with the correspondence that holds between the character of his experience and the thought that the experience has a specific character (compare Poston 2007). Recall that on the traditional account, knowledge by acquaintance requires more than only being acquainted with the truth-maker for one’s belief, it also involves some kind of awareness of the correspondence or fit that holds between one’s thought and the experience that is the basis for one’s thought. A second proposal is based on phenomenal concepts (compare Feldman 2004). A phenomenal concept is a concept that one can immediately recognize (for example, being three-sided) as opposed to a concept that involves a process of thought to recognize (for example, being 27-sided). Restricting knowledge by acquaintance to belief-states involving phenomenal concepts can accommodate the challenge of the speckled hen by plausibly maintaining that the concept of being 48-speckled is not a phenomenal concept and thereby not a candidate for knowledge by acquaintance. Third, one can maintain that there are degrees between determinate and determinable properties with which one is acquainted (compare Fales 1996, pp. 173-180). Properties fall on a continuum between being more general to being more specific or determined. For example, a ripe tomato’s surface can be described generally as colored, more determinately as red, or even more determinately as vermilion. Given this distinction in the determinateness of properties, it is possible that one could be directly acquainted with differing degrees of determinable properties. If experiences can instantiate varying degrees of these determinable properties (and this is a matter of controversy that cannot be addressed here), then in cases like the speckled hen the acquaintance theorist may hold that the subject is not directly acquainted with the experience of a hen with 48 speckles but with the experience having a less determinate property such as the property of being many-speckled. Thus, in cases akin to the speckled hen, the subject may not be acquainted with the property of being 48-speckled, but with a less determinate property like being many-speckled.

  Another proposed solution to the problem of the speckled hen follows from distinguishing between the phenomenal and epistemic appearances of an experience (Gertler 2011, pp. 103-106). The phenomenal appearance of an experience is determined by the properties that constitute the experience. The epistemic appearance of an experience is what the experience inclines the subject to believe. For example, if someone takes a white plate and holds it under a green light, the plate phenomenally appears green (that is, the property of being green partly constitutes the experience of the plate) but with sufficient knowledge of the effects of green lighting on white objects, it does not epistemically appear green (that is, the subject is not inclined to think that the plate is green). In cases like the speckled hen, then, the experience may phenomenally appear to be 48-speckled, but it may only epistemically appear to be many-speckled. The key to this solution is disambiguating the meaning of “appearance” to explain how in one sense the subject may have an appearance of a hen with 48 speckles (phenomenally) and in another sense the subject may not have an appearance of a hen with 48 speckles (epistemically).

  With respect to the Sellarsian dilemma, one response takes the horn of the dilemma that states propositional beliefs derive their justification from non-propositional experiences. For instance, Fumerton (1995, pp. 74-76) proposes an account of knowledge by acquaintance (see above section 2b) where the subject is in a position to know a truth through three acquaintances. Since acquaintance by itself is not an epistemic concept in need of justification, it enables the subject to be appropriately related to the source of one’s justification without necessitating further levels of justification. Thus, in response to the challenge to explain how non-propositional experiences (such as the raw experience of searing pain) can justify propositional thoughts (such as the belief that I am experiencing pain), Fumerton maintains that justification is made possible by being directly acquainted with the relation of correspondence that holds between the non-propositional experience and the propositional thought.

  BonJour offers another influential response to Sellars’s dilemma (2001, pp. 28-34; 2003, especially pp. 69-74). On BonJour’s account of basic empirical knowledge (see above section 2b), the awareness or apprehension of the justification for one’s belief is built-in or partly constitutive of the justifying non-conceptual experience. While non-conceptual experiences do not stand in certain kinds of logical relations (for example, inferring) to conceptual beliefs, there is a relation of description or fit that holds between experiences and beliefs. Since certain kinds of experiences have a built-in awareness of their contents, these experiences contain within themselves a kind of reason for thinking that the given description accurately fits. The crucial move in BonJour’s solution is to see that the built-in awareness renders the basic empirical belief justified without any further need for justification.

  Staunch defenders of the Sellarsian dilemma will likely remain unimpressed with these responses. The problem, they might urge, is that these alleged solutions push the problem back a level. Those defending the dilemma will press these proposals to explain how propositional beliefs can correspond or accurately describe non-propositional experiences. In some places, Fumerton and BonJour seem to suggest that first-hand experience with our own conscious states of mind adequately demonstrate how these relations are able to hold (Fumerton 1995, p. 77; BonJour 2003, pp. 69-74).

  Other friends of direct acquaintance have suggested that experiences, while being non-propositional, may have a propositional structure (or proto-propositional structure) that allows for propositional content to map onto it (Fales 1996, pp. 166-169). For example, a non-propositional experience may be constituted by presenting particulars exemplifying specific properties, which naturally provides a structure resembling statements in the subject-predicate form. Timothy McGrew contends that basic empirical beliefs can be formed by indexically referring to one’s non-propositional experience as part of what constitutes the propositional content of the belief (1995, especially pp. 89-90). By embedding the non-propositional content as a constituent part of the belief (for example, “I am being appeared to thusly”), it is possible to show how non-propositional experiences may provide a basis for forming justified propositional beliefs (for some concerns about the richness of indexically formed beliefs to serve as a foundation see Sosa 2003b, especially pp. 122-124).

  3. The Philosophy of Mind and Knowledge by Acquaintance

  While knowledge by acquaintance has its most immediate application to philosophical topics in epistemology, it has increasingly been applied to issues in metaphysics, especially in the philosophy of mind. In particular, knowledge by acquaintance has played a role in the knowledge argument against physicalism. Some argue that knowledge of qualia is direct and unmediated, which provides an insight into the nature of the mind that cannot be known through the physical sciences. Frank Jackson presents this argument through a compelling thought experiment about Mary (Jackson 1982; 1986). Mary is a scientist who learns all the physical truths from her exhaustive study of the completed physics. For whatever reasons, Mary has lived her entire life without experiencing any colors besides black, white, and shades of gray. One day after she has mastered all the physical truths and everything that can be deduced a priori from them, Mary leaves her black-and-white environment and sees a ripe tomato.  Intuitively, it seems that Mary learns something new with this experience; she learns this is what it’s like to have a red experience. Since Mary knew all the physical truths prior to seeing the ripe tomato and since Mary learned something new about the world after seeing the ripe tomato, the implication of the thought experiment, then, is that physicalism is false.

  More recently David Chalmers has made use of knowledge by acquaintance to support property dualism in the same vein as the knowledge argument. His arguments rely in part on the notion that our direct knowledge of phenomenal conscious states justifies our beliefs about them (see Chalmers 1996, especially pp. 196-198; 2004; 2007). Among his arguments is the case from the asymmetry between one’s knowledge of consciousness and the rest of the world (Chalmers 1996, pp. 101-103). A person’s knowledge of consciousness is based on first-hand, direct experiences of it, not evidence that is external to one’s immediate access. His argument, roughly stated, is that since subjects know by acquaintance that phenomenal consciousness exists and possesses certain features, and this knowledge cannot be deduced a priori from one’s knowledge of physical truths, it follows that these features of conscious experience are not physical.

  Some philosophers have attempted to defend physicalist theories of mind with the notion of knowledge by acquaintance, albeit by employing a non-traditional approach to knowledge by acquaintance (compared to the traditional approach as described in section 1 and section 2). Generally these approaches have endorsed that knowledge by acquaintance is nothing more than a subject’s being directly acquainted with a property or fact, and they have deviated from the traditional position that knowledge by acquaintance requires propositional belief (see Conee 1994 and Tye 2009). Those who use knowledge by acquaintance to defend physicalism claim that the knowledge argument only highlights two different ways of knowing the same thing. One way this case has been made is by suggesting that one can know all the propositional truths about something (for example, the city of Houston) and yet not know it directly. The difference between knowledge of phenomenal consciousness and knowledge of brain states is like the difference between knowing about Houston (by reading a very thorough visitor’s guide) and knowing Houston directly (by visiting the city). According to these views, it is because knowledge by acquaintance is a different kind of knowledge that phenomenal knowledge appears to differ from descriptive, physical knowledge about brain states. Although there is not space for a full evaluation of these views, one problem that has been raised is that knowledge by acquaintance cannot by itself account for the epistemic disparity that this solution is attempting to solve (see Nida-Rümelin 1995; Gertler 1999). In other words, the problem is that there appears to be propositional, factual content about the properties of conscious experience that these non-standard accounts of knowledge by acquaintance fail to capture.

  4. Conclusion

  The distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description has a number of important applications in philosophy. In epistemology, it underwrites a tradition from Bertrand Russell that continues to influence debates on the nature of foundationalism and the possibility of a privileged class of knowledge. In metaphysics, knowledge by acquaintance has increasingly been incorporated into arguments concerning the nature of conscious experience and the viability of physicalism. The current trend suggests that knowledge by acquaintance will continue to be refined and put to work on a variety of philosophical fronts.

  3. Russell’s Work in Analytic Philosophy
  In much the same way that Russell used logic in an attempt to clarify issues in the foundations of mathematics, he also used logic in an attempt to clarify issues in philosophy. As one of the founders of analytic philosophy, Russell made significant contributions to a wide variety of areas, including metaphysics, epistemology, ethics and political theory. His advances in logic and metaphysics also had significant influence on Rudolf Carnap and the Vienna Circle.

  According to Russell, it is the philosopher’s job to discover a logically ideal language – a language capable of describing the world in such a way that we will not be misled by the accidental, imprecise surface structure of natural language. As Russell writes, “Ordinary language is totally unsuited for expressing what physics really asserts, since the words of everyday life are not sufficiently abstract. Only mathematics and mathematical logic can say as little as the physicist means to say” (1931, 82). Just as atomic facts (the association of properties and relations with individuals) combine to form molecular facts in the world itself, such a language will allow for the description of such combinations using logical connectives such as “and” and “or.” In addition to the existence of atomic and molecular facts, Russell also held that general facts (facts about “all” of something) are needed to complete our picture of the world. Famously, he vacillated on whether negative facts are also required (1918, 1919).

  The reason Russell believes many ordinarily accepted statements are open to doubt is that they appear to refer to entities that may be known only through inference. Thus, underlying Russell’s various projects was not only his use of logical analysis, but also his long-standing aim of discovering whether, and to what extent, knowledge is possible. “There is one great question,” he writes in 1911. “Can human beings know anything, and if so, what and how? This question is really the most essentially philosophical of all questions” (quoted in Slater 1994, 67).

  Motivating this question was the traditional problem of the external world. If our knowledge of the external world comes through inferences to the best explanation, and if such inferences are always fallible, what guarantee do we have that our beliefs are true? Russell’s response to this question was partly metaphysical and partly epistemological. On the metaphysical side, Russell developed his famous theory of logical atomism, in which the world is said to consist of a complex of logical atoms (such as “little patches of colour”) and their properties and relations. (The theory was crucial for influencing Wittgenstein’s theory of the same name.) Together these atoms and their properties form the facts which, in turn, combine to form logically complex objects. What we normally take to be inferred entities (for example, enduring physical objects) are then understood as logical constructions formed from the immediately given entities of sensation, viz., “sensibilia.”

  On the epistemological side, Russell argues that it is also important to show how each questionable entity may be reduced to, or defined in terms of, another entity (or entities) whose existence is more certain. For example, on this view, an ordinary physical object that normally might be thought to be known only through inference may be defined instead

  as a certain series of appearances, connected with each other by continuity and by certain causal laws. … More generally, a ‘thing’ will be defined as a certain series of aspects, namely those which would commonly be said to be of the thing. To say that a certain aspect is an aspect of a certain thing will merely mean that it is one of those which, taken serially, are the thing. (1914a, 106–107)
  The reason we are able to do this, says Russell, is that

  our world is not wholly a matter of inference. There are things that we know without asking the opinion of men of science. If you are too hot or too cold, you can be perfectly aware of this fact without asking the physicist what heat and cold consist of. … We may give the name ‘data’ to all the things of which we are aware without inference. (1959, 23)
  We can then use these data (or “sensibilia” or “sense data”) with which we are directly acquainted to construct the relevant objects of knowledge. Similarly, numbers may be reduced to collections of classes; points and instants may be reduced to ordered classes of volumes and events; and classes themselves may be reduced to propositional functions.

  It is with these kinds of examples in mind that Russell suggests we adopt what he calls “the supreme maxim in scientific philosophizing,” namely the principle that “Whenever possible, logical constructions,” or as he also sometimes puts it, “logical fictions,” are “to be substituted for inferred entities” (1914c, 155; cf. 1914a, 107, and 1924, 326). Anything that resists construction in this sense may be said to be an ontological atom. Such objects are atomic, both in the sense that they fail to be composed of individual, substantial parts, and in the sense that they exist independently of one another. Their corresponding propositions are also atomic, both in the sense that they contain no other propositions as parts, and in the sense that the members of any pair of true atomic propositions will be logically independent of one another. Russell believes that formal logic, if carefully developed, will mirror precisely, not only the various relations between all such propositions, but their various internal structures as well.

  It is in this context that Russell also introduces his famous distinction between two kinds of knowledge of truths: that which is direct, intuitive, certain and infallible, and that which is indirect, derivative, uncertain and open to error (1905, 41f; 1911, 1912, and 1914b). To be justified, every indirect knowledge claim must be capable of being derived from more fundamental, direct or intuitive knowledge claims. The kinds of truths that are capable of being known directly include truths about immediate facts of sensation and truths of logic. Examples are discussed in The Problems of Philosophy (1912a) where Russell states that propositions with the highest degree of self-evidence (what he here calls “intuitive knowledge”) include “those which merely state what is given in sense, and also certain abstract logical and arithmetical principles, and (though with less certainty) some ethical propositions” (1912a, 109).

  Eventually, Russell supplemented this distinction between direct and indirect knowledge of truths with his equally famous distinction between knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description. As Russell explains, “I say that I am acquainted with an object when I have a direct cognitive relation to that object, i.e. when I am directly aware of the object itself. When I speak of a cognitive relation here, I do not mean the sort of relation which constitutes judgment, but the sort which constitutes presentation” (1911, 209). Later, he clarifies this point by adding that acquaintance involves, not knowledge of truths, but knowledge of things (1912a, 44). Thus, while intuitive knowledge and derivative knowledge both involve knowledge of propositions (or truths), knowledge by acquaintance and knowledge by description both involve knowledge of things (or objects). This distinction is slightly complicated by the fact that, even though knowledge by description is in part based upon knowledge of truths, it is still knowledge of things, and not of truths. (I am grateful to Russell Wahl for reminding me of this point.) Since it is things with which we have direct acquaintance that are the least questionable members of our ontology, it is these objects upon which Russell ultimately bases his epistemology.

  Also relevant was Russell’s reliance upon his so-called regressive method (Irvine 1989, Mayo-Wilson 2011) and his eventual abandoning of foundationalism in favour of a more recognizably coherentist approach to knowledge (Irvine 2004). As Russell puts it, even in logic and mathematics

  We tend to believe the premises because we can see that their consequences are true, instead of believing the consequences because we know the premises to be true. But the inferring of premises from consequences is the essence of induction; thus the method in investigating the principles of mathematics is really an inductive method, and is substantially the same as the method of discovering general laws in any other science. (1907, 273–274)
  Russell’s contributions to metaphysics and epistemology are also unified by his views concerning the centrality of scientific knowledge and the importance of there being an underlying methodology common to philosophy and science. In the case of philosophy, this methodology expresses itself through Russell’s use of logical analysis (Hager 1994, Irvine 2004). In fact, Russell often claims that he has more confidence in his methodology than in any particular philosophical conclusion.

  This broad conception of philosophy arose in part from Russell’s idealist origins (Hylton 1990a, Griffin 1991). This is so, even though Russell tells us that his one, true revolution in philosophy came as a result of his break from idealism. Russell saw that the idealist doctrine of internal relations led to a series of contradictions regarding asymmetrical (and other) relations necessary for mathematics. As he reports,

  It was towards the end of 1898 that Moore and I rebelled against both Kant and Hegel. Moore led the way, but I followed closely in his footsteps. … [Our rebellion centred upon] the doctrine that fact is in general independent of experience. Although we were in agreement, I think that we differed as to what most interested us in our new philosophy. I think that Moore was most concerned with the rejection of idealism, while I was most interested in the rejection of monism. (1959, 54)
  The two ideas were closely connected through the so-called doctrine of internal relations. In contrast to this doctrine, Russell proposed his own new doctrine of external relations:

  The doctrine of internal relations held that every relation between two terms expresses, primarily, intrinsic properties of the two terms and, in ultimate analysis, a property of the whole which the two compose. With some relations this view is plausible. Take, for example, love or hate. If A loves B, this relation exemplifies itself and may be said to consist in certain states of mind of A. Even an atheist must admit that a man can love God. It follows that love of God is a state of the man who feels it, and not properly a relational fact. But the relations that interested me were of a more abstract sort. Suppose that A and B are events, and A is earlier than B. I do not think that this implies anything in A in virtue of which, independently of B, it must have a character which we inaccurately express by mentioning B. Leibniz gives an extreme example. He says that, if a man living in Europe has a wife in India and the wife dies without his knowing it, the man undergoes an intrinsic change at the moment of her death. (1959, 54)
  This is the type of doctrine Russell opposed, especially with respect to the asymmetrical relations necessary for mathematics. For example, consider two numbers, one of which is found earlier than the other in a given series:

  If A is earlier than B, then B is not earlier than A. If you try to express the relation of A to B by means of adjectives of A and B, you will have to make the attempt by means of dates. You may say that the date of A is a property of A and the date of B is a property of B, but that will not help you because you will have to go on to say that the date of A is earlier than the date of B, so that you will have found no escape from the relation. If you adopt the plan of regarding the relation as a property of the whole composed of A and B, you are in a still worse predicament, for in that whole A and B have no order and therefore you cannot distinguish between “A is earlier than B” and “B is earlier than A.” As asymmetrical relations are essential in most parts of mathematics, this doctrine was important. (1959, 54–55)
  Thus, by the end of 1898 Russell had abandoned the idealism that he had been encouraged to adopt as a student at Cambridge, along with his original Kantian methodology. In its place he adopted a new, pluralistic realism. As a result, he soon became famous as an advocate of “the new realism” and of his “new philosophy of logic,” emphasizing as he did the importance of modern logic for philosophical analysis. The underlying themes of this revolution included Russell’s belief in pluralism, his emphasis on anti-psychologism and his belief in the importance of science. Each of these themes remained central to his philosophy for the remainder of his life (Hager 1994, Weitz 1944).

  Russell’s most important writings relating to these topics include Knowledge by Acquaintance and Knowledge by Description (1911), The Problems of Philosophy (1912a), “Our Knowledge of the External World” (1914a), On the Nature of Acquaintance (1914b, published more completely in Collected Papers, Vol. 7), “The Philosophy of Logical Atomism” (1918, 1919), “Logical Atomism” (1924), The Analysis of Mind (1921), The Analysis of Matter (1927a), Human Knowledge: Its Scope and Limits (1948), and Theory of Knowledge (CP, Vol. 7).

    In linguistics, evidentiality[1][2] is, broadly, the indication of the nature of evidence for a given statement; that is, whether evidence exists for the statement and if so, what kind. An evidential (also verificational or validational) is the particular grammatical element (affix, clitic, or particle) that indicates evidentiality. Languages with only a single evidential have had terms such as mediative, médiatif, médiaphorique, and indirective used instead of evidential.
    Evidentiality may be direct or indirect: direct evidentials are used to describe information directly perceived by the speaker through vision as well as other sensory experiences while indirect evidentials consist of the other grammatical markers for evidence such as quotatives and inferentials.[3]
    Contents
    Introduction
    All languages have some means of specifying the source of information. European languages (such as Germanic and Romance languages) often indicate evidential-type information through modal verbs (Spanish: deber de, Dutch: zouden, Danish: skulle, German: sollen) or other lexical words (adverbials, English: reportedly) or phrases (English: it seems to me).
    Some languages have a distinct grammatical category of evidentiality that is required to be expressed at all times. The elements in European languages indicating the information source are optional and usually do not indicate evidentiality as their primary function; thus, they do not form a grammatical category. The obligatory elements of grammatical evidentiality systems may be translated into English, variously, as I hear that, I see that, I think that, as I hear, as I can see, as far as I understand, they say, it is said, it seems, it seems to me that, it looks like, it appears that, it turns out that, alleged, stated, allegedly, reportedly, obviously, etc.
    Alexandra Aikhenvald (2004)[4] reports that about a quarter of the world's languages have some type of grammatical evidentiality. She also reports that, to her knowledge, no research has been conducted on grammatical evidentiality in sign languages. Laura Mazzoni (2008) has since conducted a preliminary study on evidentiality in Italian Sign Language (LIS).[5]
    Many languages with grammatical evidentiality mark evidentiality independently from tense-aspect or epistemic modality, which is the speaker's evaluation of the information, i.e. whether it is reliable, uncertain, probable.
    Grammatical evidentiality may be expressed in different forms depending on the language, such as through affixes, clitics, or particles. For example, Japanese has inferential evidentials and reportive markers that are realized as suffixes on a variety of mainly verbal predicates, and as grammaticalized nouns.[6] In another example, Eastern Pomo has four evidential suffixes that are added to verbs: -ink’e (nonvisual sensory), -ine (inferential), -·le (hearsay), and -ya (direct knowledge).
    Evidentials in Eastern Pomo[7]
    Evidential type	Example verb	Gloss
    nonvisual sensory	pʰa·békʰ-ink’e	"burned"
    [speaker felt the sensation]
    inferential	pʰa·bék-ine	"must have burned"
    [speaker saw circumstantial evidence]
    hearsay (reportative)	pʰa·békʰ-·le	"burned, they say"
    [speaker is reporting what was told]
    direct knowledge	pʰa·bék-a	"burned"
    [speaker has direct evidence, probably visual]
    The use of evidentiality has pragmatic implications in languages that do not mark evidentiality distinctly from epistemic modality. For example, a person who makes a false statement qualified as a belief may be considered mistaken; a person who makes a false statement qualified as a personally observed fact will probably be considered to have lied.
    In some languages, evidential markers also serve other purposes, such as indicating the speaker's attitude towards, or belief in, the statement. Usually a direct evidential marker may serve to indicate that the speaker is certain about the event stated. Using an indirect evidential marker, such as one for hearsay or reported information, may indicate that the speaker is uncertain about the statement, or doesn't want to take responsibility for its truth. A "hearsay" evidential may then have the undertone of "that's what they say; whether or not it's true is nothing I can take responsibility for". In other languages, this is not the case. Therefore one should distinguish between such evidential markers that only mark source of knowledge, and such evidential markers that serve other functions, such as marking epistemic modality.
    Evidentials can also be used to "deflect culpability"[8] in a statement. In his dissertation on Nanti, a Peruvian Amazonian language, Lev Michael refers to an example in which a young girl is accidentally burned, and a community member questions her mother about how it happened. Her mother uses the evidential marker ka which translates to "presumably," to deflect responsibility for the girl's mistake.[8]
    Some languages are borderline cases. For example, the Romance languages are mostly like English in not having grammatical evidentiality, but do have a conditional mood which has three uses: conditions, future-in-the-past, and hearsay. Thus in journalistic French, there is frequently a distinction between Il a reconnu sa culpabilité and Il aurait reconnu sa culpabilité: both translate to "He has admitted his guilt," but with an implication of certainty with the first, and the idea of "reportedly" with the second. The same happens in Spanish (Él ha reconocido su culpa vs. Él habría reconocido su culpa) and in Portuguese (Ele reconheceu sua culpa vs. Ele teria reconhecido sua culpa).
    Alexandra Aikhenvald identified five semantic categories that recurrently occur across languages of the world:[9][10]
    Visual Sensory
    Non-Visual Sensory
    Inferentials
    Hearsay Reportatives
    Quotative Reportatives
    No language has been reported to have special forms for smell, taste or feeling although these may be covered by non-visual evidentials.[11][12]
    Types according to Aikhenvald
    Following the typology of Alexandra Aikhenvald[4][13], there are two broad types of evidential marking:
    indirectivity marking ("type I")
    evidential marking ("type II")
    The first type (indirectivity) indicates whether evidence exists for a given statement, but does not specify what kind of evidence. The second type (evidentiality proper) specifies the kind of evidence (such as whether the evidence is visual, reported, or inferred).
    Indirectivity (type I)
    Indirectivity (also known as inferentiality) systems are common in Uralic and Turkic languages. These languages indicate whether evidence exists for a given source of information; thus, they contrast direct information (reported directly) and indirect information (reported indirectly, focusing on its reception by the speaker/recipient). Unlike the other evidential "type II" systems, an indirectivity marking does not indicate information about the source of knowledge: it is irrelevant whether the information results from hearsay, inference, or perception; however, some Turkic languages distinguish between reported indirect and non-reported indirect, see Johanson 2003, 2000 for further elaboration. This can be seen in the following Turkish verbs:
    gel-di
    come-past
    "came"
    gel-miş
    come-indir.past
    "obviously came, came (as far as understood)"[14]
    In the word geldi, the unmarked suffix -di indicates past tense. In the second word gelmiş, the suffix -miş also indicates past tense but indirectly. It may be translated into English with the added phrases 'obviously', 'apparently' or 'as far as I understand'. The direct past tense marker -di is unmarked (or neutral) in the sense that whether or not evidence exists supporting the statement is not specified.
    Evidentiality (type II)
    The other broad type of evidentiality systems ("type II") specifies the nature of the evidence supporting a statement. These kinds of evidence can be divided into such categories as:
    Sensory
    Visual
    Non-visual
    Inferential
    Assumed
    Reportative
    Hearsay
    Quotative
    Sensory evidentials can often be divided into different types. Some languages mark visual evidence differently from nonvisual evidence that is heard, smelled, or felt. The Kashaya language has a separate auditory evidential.
    An inferential evidential indicates information was not personally experienced but was inferred from indirect evidence. Some languages have different types of inferential evidentials. Some of the inferentials found indicate:
    Information inferred by direct physical evidence
    Information inferred by general knowledge
    Information inferred/assumed because of speaker's experience with similar situations
    Past deferred realization
    In many cases, different inferential evidentials also indicate epistemic modality, such as uncertainty or probability (see epistemic modality below). For example, one evidential may indicate that the information is inferred but of uncertain validity, while another indicates that the information is inferred but unlikely to be true.
    Reportative evidentials indicate that the information was reported to the speaker by another person. A few languages distinguish between hearsay evidentials and quotative evidentials. Hearsay indicates reported information that may or may not be accurate. A quotative indicates the information is accurate and not open to interpretation, i.e., is a direct quotation. An example of a reportative from Shipibo (-ronki):
    Aronkiai.
    a-
    do-
    ronki-
    reprt-
    ai
    incompl
    "It is said that she will do it." / "She says that she will do it."[15]
    Typology of evidentiality systems
    The following is a brief survey of evidential systems found in the languages of the world as identified in Aikhenvald (2004).[4] Some languages only have two evidential markers while others may have six or more. The system types are organized by the number of evidentials found in the language. For example, a two-term system (A) will have two different evidential markers; a three-term system (B) will have three different evidentials. The systems are further divided by the type of evidentiality that is indicated (e.g. A1, A2, A3, etc.). Languages that exemplify each type are listed in parentheses.
    The most common system found is the A3 type.
    Two-term systems:
    A1. witness, nonwitness (e.g. Jarawara, Yukaghir languages, Mỹky, Godoberi, Kalasha-mun, Khowar, Yanam)
    A2. nonfirsthand, everything else (e.g. Abkhaz, Mansi, Khanty, Nenets, Enets, Selkup, Northeast Caucasian languages)
    A3. reported, everything else (e.g. Turkic languages, Tamil, Enga, Tauya, Lezgian, Kham, Estonian, Livonian, Tibeto-Burman languages, several South American languages)
    Three-term systems:
    B1. visual sensory, inferential, reportative (e.g. Aymara, Shastan languages, Qiang languages, Maidu, most Quechuan languages, Northern Embera languages)
    B2. visual sensory, nonvisual sensory, inferential (e.g. Washo)
    B3. nonvisual sensory, inferential, reportative (e.g. Retuarã, Northern Pomo)
    B4. witness (direct), nonwitness (indirect), inferential, reportative (e.g. Tsezic[16] and Dagestanian languages)
    Four-term systems:
    C1. visual sensory, nonvisual sensory, inferential, reportative (e.g. Tariana, Xamatauteri, Eastern Pomo, East Tucanoan languages)
    C2. visual sensory, inferential #1, inferential #2, reportative (e.g. Tsafiki, Pawnee, Ancash Quechua)
    C3. nonvisual sensory, inferential #1, inferential #2, reportative (e.g. Wintu)
    C4. visual sensory, inferential, reportative #1, reportative #2 (e.g. Southeastern Tepehuan)
    C5. witness (non-subjective, non-renarrative), inferential (subjective, non-renarrative), renarrative (non-subjective, renarrative), dubitative (subjective, renarrative) (e.g. Bulgarian)[17]
    Five-plus term systems:
    visual sensory, nonvisual sensory, inferential, reportative, assumed (e.g. Tuyuca, Tucano)
    witness, inferential, reportative, assumed, "internal support" (e.g. Nambikwaran languages)
    visual sensory, nonvisual sensory, inferential, reported, heard from known source, direct participation (e.g. Fasu)
    nonvisual sensory, inferential #1, inferential #2, inferential #3, reportative (e.g. Western Apache)
    inferential, anticipation, performative, deduction, induction, hearsay, direct observation, opinion, assumed, "to know by culture", "to know by internal" (Lojban)[18]
    Evidentiality marking and other categories
    Evidential systems in many languages are often marked simultaneously with other linguistic categories.[19] For example, according to Aikhenvald, a given language may use the same element to mark both evidentiality and mirativity, i.e., unexpected information. She claims that this is the case of Western Apache where the post-verbal particle lą̄ą̄ primarily functions as a mirative but also has a secondary function as an inferential evidential. This phenomenon of evidentials developing secondary functions, or other grammatical elements such as miratives and modal verbs developing evidential functions is fairly widespread. The following types of mixed systems have been reported:
    evidentiality with mirativity
    evidentiality with tense-aspect
    evidentiality with modality (this is discussed in the next section below)
    In addition to the interactions with tense, modality, and mirativity, the usage of evidentials in some languages may also depend on the clause type, discourse structure, and/or linguistic genre.
    However, despite the intersection of evidentiality systems with other semantic or pragmatic systems (through grammatical categories), Aikhenvald believes that several languages do mark evidentiality without any grammatical connection to these other semantic/pragmatic systems. More explicitly stated, she believes that there are modal systems which do not express evidentiality, and evidential systems which do not express modality. Likewise, there are mirative systems which do not express evidentiality, and evidential systems which do not express mirativity.
    Aside from those, egophoricity may interact with evidentiality as well.[20]
    Tense
    Some languages may only distinguish between direct and indirect evidentials in the past tense.[21] This is the case for Georgian (Kartvelian), Turkish (Turkic), Komi-Zyrian (Finno-Ugric), Haida (a language isolate in British Columbia and Alaska), and Ika (Chibchan).[22]
    Epistemic modality
    Evidentiality is often considered to be a sub-type of epistemic modality (see, for example, Palmer 1986, Kiefer 1994). Other linguists consider evidentiality (marking the source of information in a statement) to be distinct from epistemic modality (marking the degree of confidence in a statement). An English example:
    I see that he is coming. (evidential)
    I know that he is coming. (epistemic)
    For instance, de Haan[23][24][25] states that evidentiality asserts evidence while epistemic modality evaluates evidence and that evidentiality is more akin to a deictic category marking the relationship between speakers and events/actions (like the way demonstratives mark the relationship between speakers and objects; see also Joseph 2003). Aikhenvald (2003)[2] finds that evidentials may indicate a speaker's attitude about the validity of a statement but this is not a required feature of evidentials. Additionally, she finds that evidential-marking may co-occur with epistemic-marking, but it may also co-occur with aspectual/tense or mirative marking.
    Considering evidentiality as a type of epistemic modality may only be the result of analyzing non-European languages in terms of the systems of modality found in European languages. For example, the modal verbs in Germanic languages are used to indicate both evidentiality and epistemic modality (and are thus ambiguous when taken out of context). Other (non-European) languages clearly mark these differently. De Haan (2001)[24] finds that the use of modal verbs to indicate evidentiality is comparatively rare (based on a sample of 200 languages).
    Clause type
    Evidential categories are more likely to be marked in a main declarative clause than in the other types of clauses.[26] In some languages, however, evidential forms may appear in questions or commands as well.[26]
    Terminology
    Although some linguists have proposed that evidentiality should be considered separately from epistemic modality, other linguists conflate the two. Because of this conflation, some researchers use the term evidentiality to refer both to the marking of the knowledge source and the commitment to the truth of the knowledge.
    In English (not grammaticalized)
    Evidentiality is not considered a grammatical category in English because it is expressed in diverse ways and is always optional. In contrast, many other languages (including Quechua, Aymara, and Yukaghir) require the speaker to mark the main verb or the sentence as a whole for evidentiality, or offer an optional set of affixes for indirect evidentiality, with direct experience being the default assumed mode of evidentiality.
    Consider these English sentences:
    I am hungry.
    Bob is hungry.
    We are unlikely to say the second unless someone (perhaps Bob himself) has told us that Bob is hungry. (We might still say it for someone incapable of speaking for themself, such as a baby or a pet.) If we are simply assuming that Bob is hungry based on the way he looks or acts, we are more likely to say something like:
    Bob looks hungry.
    Bob seems hungry.
    Bob would be hungry by now.
    Bob must be hungry by now.
    Here, the fact that we are relying on sensory evidence, rather than direct experience, is conveyed by our use of the word look or seem.
    Another situation in which the evidential modality is expressed in English is in certain kinds of predictions, namely those based on the evidence at hand. These can be referred to as "predictions with evidence". Examples:
    Look at those clouds! It's going to rain! (Compare "It will rain!").
    Possible exceptions
    The suffix "-ish" can be considered to be a grammaticalized marker of uncertainty.
    Western history of the concept
    The notion of evidentiality as obligatory grammatical information was first made apparent in 1911 by Franz Boas in his introduction to The Handbook of American Indian Languages in a discussion of Kwakiutl and in his grammatical sketch of Tsimshianic. The term evidential was first used in the current linguistic sense by Roman Jakobson in 1957 in reference to Balkan Slavic (Jacobsen 1986:4; Jakobson 1990) with the following definition:
    "EnEns/Es evidential is a tentative label for the verbal category which takes into account three events — a narrated event (En), a speech event (Es), and a narrated speech event (Ens). The speaker reports an event on the basis of someone else's report (quotative, i.e. hearsay evidence), of a dream (revelative evidence), of a guess (presumptive evidence) or of his own previous experience (memory evidence)."
    Jakobson also was the first to clearly separate evidentiality from grammatical mood. By the middle of the 1960s, evidential and evidentiality were established terms in linguistic literature.
    Systems of evidentiality have received focused linguistic attention only relatively recently. The first major work to examine evidentiality cross-linguistically is Chafe & Nichols (1986). A more recent typological comparison is Aikhenvald (2004).[4]

  Are you familiar with Bertrand Russell's knowledge of philosophy and on denoting?  He breaks knowledge into knowledge-by and knowledge-that. The former is experiential knowledge, what Germans would say kennen and what GenZ call the vibes. Knowledge that are facts- things Popper loves because they can be falsified and have been evaluated as not falsified to a statistically satisfactory level. But I keep saying both that "LLMs don't have knowledge" and also "the LLM knows". And it's bugging me, it's contradictory and I haven't been able to explain it beyond "we use intentional language because human flesh brain sack" I think... I think I have a reconciliation. There's a form of knowledge-by, non inferential knowledge, that Russell describes and that I'm going to call knowledge-of.  Knowledge that are true facts; falsifiable statements that have been validated. Knowledge of are vibes and non falsifiable or non validated. Knowledge of is repetition of knowledge from other sources. Hearsay, in the legal profession. All knowledge here is experiential; each has different levels of confidence. LLMs do "have" (display?) knowledge-of, with commensurately low confidence in the verisimilitude of displayed knowledge.


  jessica
  I mean, I think the Russell paradigm is a good fig leaf for using “know”—I’m still not sure it’s the same thing we do when we know.  Because we don’t necessarily make a clear distinction - (Especially in English—there are languages that distinguish between what you know firsthand and what you have only heard or know through collective knowledge and so on).  We can experience factual knowledge.  And what helps us understand things we haven’t experienced (whether it’s knowledge-that or knowledge-of) Is a similar process to making sense of knowledge-of There’s a reason that we reason by analogy and our legal system is narrative and we do word problems in math.  We approach knowledge-that, often, as if it were knowledge-of.  What I might say is that LLMs have only memory.  But it’s hard to imagine what that’s like, experientially.  They have a body of knowledge they can access.  And they have language.


  david
  Only a very fuzzy memory, No experience with which to push on it.


  jessica
  Right. Or to contextualize it. Or to understand it


  david
  No semantics.  Semantics are missing from that above.  As... I dunno, the connective tissue? Of getting between Knowledges That?


  jessica
  Like, I kind of wonder if chain-of-thought prompting works simply because we have lots of examples of it, of people describing their thoughts process.  Is it that LLMs process knowledge differently if they’re asked to chain-of-thought? Or do they give different answers because they’re pulling from completely different examples/statistical relationships


  david
  I think that's part of it, but I've argued more that ours because you get a longer context window and a higher temperature I think more the latter


  jessica
  That makes sense


  david
  I challenge the assertion that we have lots of examples of Train of thought, relative to other chunks of content


  jessica
  Fair challenge!  I think of things like explaining hypotheses and methodology as being in that category But you’re right, the format is different


  david
  I agree, I think, and I'm not saying there's none


  jessica
  And seeing them as the same might be a human leap :-)


  david
  Just the ratio doesn't feel right (Knowledge By!)


  david
  I'm still feeling pretty good about the original bit as a way to clarify "it knows/it has no knowledge"


  jessica
  I think it’s a good distinction for knowledge


  david
  I really want to learn more on the other languages' knowledge modalities you bring up


  jessica
  I just worry that it relies on empathy for how we think to understand


  david
  Yeah you're absolutely right that it doesn't capture learning by analogy


  jessica

  david
  Gonna keep thinking on that.  I think Russell would be delighted to hear that we use the word "Vibes" casually for "knowledge-by"

There's a form of knowledge-by, non inferential knowledge, that Russell describes and that I'm going to call knowledge-of.  Knowledge that are true facts; falsifiable statements that have been validated. Knowledge of are vibes and non falsifiable or non validated.  Knowledge of is repetition of knowledge from other sources. Hearsay, in the legal profession. All knowledge here is experiential; each has different levels of confidence.  LLMs do "have" (display?) knowledge-of, with commensurately low confidence in the verisimilitude of displayed knowledge.  Did I just make a novel advancement in epistemology, or should I have known this and had these words already?

  Jenessa
  I like it!

  Jenessa
  I think there was a typo at one point. So “by” “that” and the new “of”

  david
  Yeah I wrote this in bed on my phone

  david
  I think with context each of those three comes across as distinct things?

  Jenessa
  Yeah, so LLMs have no experience of knowing, and no awareness of the actual truth value, but they sure know someone told them this

  Jenessa
  No ability to reason out whether it’s logical

  Nah it’s way more simplistic than that

  Jenessa
  This is like equivalent to muscle memory. This is like sensory receptor memory

  david
  I... thought that's what attention was

  Jenessa
  It’s not literally in the receptor, like how muscle memory isn’t in the muscle

  david
  LLMs don't have experiences so cannot have knowledge. (But that's not fair)

  Jenessa
  Explicit/declarative memory has 2: episodic and semantic
  Implicit/non-declarative has 4: procedural(muscle), non-associative(habituation/sensitization), associative(conditioning), and priming

  david
  Or, that's an overly anyhrocentric phrasing

  Jenessa

  So in Piaget, LLMs are proportional ; use language) and kind of formal operational (with what looks like logic), but zero concrete or sensorimotor...

  Jenessa
  God I forgot how delightful this video was

  That's not entirely true... from this overview slide, there are blends of all of them

  Deferred imitation: strongly
  Goal directed abortion: only with prompt engineering
  Object permanence: Not applicable

  Symbolic thought: entirely
  Egocentrism: not applicable (??)

  Logical thought: with meta prompting
  Conservation: no

  Inductive and deductive reasoning:.... develop, yes, but there's no experiential mechanism to confirm? Is that necessary and just skipped on the slide?

  Jenessa
  Yeah, so clearly it doesn’t go through the stages like a human

  david
  Why would we even think that was a reasonable hypothesis

  Jenessa
  What do you mean by-experiential mechanism?

  david
  Verifying a hypothesis

  Jenessa
  Are you asking how kids that age do that?

  david
  The slide says formal operational uses reasoning to develop hypotheses

  david
  Is it also necessary to validate those? Or do we just need to come up with them?

  Jenessa
  For humans?

  david
  Yes

  david
  Well, for humans as explained by Piaget

  Jenessa
  Like the formal versus concrete is that they can do problems in their head instead of needing to physically do it. Like looking at a diagram of a seesaw and know what way it will tip instead of needing to physical place weights on a real seesaw to figure it out

  david
  Ok I don't get it

  I should probably use more than a single slide to learn the topic

  Concrete: Here are three sticks. Can you put them in order by size? So which is biggest? Here’s a new one, where does it go?

  david
  What's the difference between a mental model and an episodic memory.

  Jenessa
  They’re wildly different.  Psychologically and neurologically.  Episodic memory will be hippocampus heavy, then calling whatever it needs to reconstruct the memory.  Problem solving and schemas are all frontal lobe stuff.

  david
  I was hoping you'd day that, Given that I'm arguing these are very different things!  From the philosophy side, and you're confirming in the brain as well.  And the linguists show they're different things

  Jenessa
  So unrelated you can do one without the other

  david
  This makes me want to look at Piaget in maybe a different light? (Or you'lol tell me this is well known) - are developmental stages describing a brain "growing into" itself? Growing to coordinate these different pieces?

  Literally yes

  Sensorimotor is physical coordination
  You replied to yourself
  Original message:

  david
  Next question (stop any time) - is a mental model and a simulation the same thing?

  david
  Or is that just new age tech bs?

  Jenessa
  Yeah I mean I don’t really use either of those terms that much

  Jenessa
  So it’s hard to say

  david
  What's the better term to use?

  Jenessa
  Like I don’t have a solid definition of either

  Jenessa
  I’ve been assuming by mental model you mean like Paiget’s schema

  Jenessa
  Schemas*

  Jenessa
  That kids get better at creating

  david
  For the process of, like, "If I buy her chocolate she will like me, if I buy him chocolate he won't because he's allergic to nuts"

  david
  Or the process of inductive mathematics

  Jenessa
  Yeah, reasoning ability is probably what I’d call it

  Jenessa
  And the exact way you do it developmentally is a schema

  Jenessa
  Like in sensorimotor, your schema for problema solving is “what is that? I must put it in my mouth to find out”

  david
  Does this look more episodic, semantic, or a gestalt of both?

  Jenessa
  None?

  Jenessa
  Like you need information to engage in reasoning I suppose, and information comes from your memory

  Jenessa
  But this is a whole other thing

  david
  So it's a third brain process?

  Jenessa
  A millionth, but sure lol

  Jenessa
  But even then, I don’t like “third”

  david
  Yeah totally fair

  Jenessa
  Semantic and episodic are types of declarative memory

  Jenessa
  Reasoning is in another bucket entirely. Not a type of memory

  david
  "Another distinct brain process"?

  Jenessa
  Yeah

  david
  Which areas are primarily activated?

  Jenessa
  This is heavy on frontal lobe

  Jenessa
  Prefrontal. The frontest of the front. The part that is very big in humans

  Jenessa
  Memory structures are deep in temporal lobe

  Jenessa
  And then of course the factual and episodic information is stores distributively all over

  Jenessa
  But the structures that call it up when needed are in different places

  Jenessa
  Like frontal going “oh jeez, what was that thing I learned in biology class? That would help here” triggers hippocampus in temporal lobe, which triggers the reconstruction of that memory

  </conversation>

  Summarize these conversations into a short blog post. Do not include the names of the conversation partners.

  knowledge-that - wissen. Facts. Knowledge by description.
  knowledge-by - kennen. Vices. Knowledge by acquaintance.
  knowlege-of - conveyances and hearsay. Conversation.

  Language is an encoding of knowledge-that and knowledge-by.

  Focus on explaining the importance of a linguistic agent to use knowledge-of from another agent to develop knowledge-that.
  Tailor the explanation to resolve the contradiction of stating "An LLM does not have knowledge" (in the knowledge-that usage) with "The LLM knows" (in the knowledge-of usage).

  <draft>
  Here is a draft blog post summarizing the conversations:

  Title: Distinguishing Between Knowledge-That, Knowledge-By, and Knowledge-Of

  In philosophy, Bertrand Russell made an important distinction between two types of knowledge - knowledge-that and knowledge-by. Knowledge-that refers to factual, descriptive knowledge that can be stated propositions or truth claims. This aligns with the German concept of wissen. Knowledge-by, on the other hand, refers to experiential, acquaintance-based knowledge. This is akin to the German kennen or what Gen Z might call "the vibes."

  However, there seems to be a third type of knowledge that isn't fully captured by Russell's framework - knowledge-of. This refers to second-hand knowledge gained through conveyances and hearsay rather than direct experience. It is knowledge gained through conversation and language rather than personal observation or logical deduction.

  The distinction between these three types of knowledge is critical for understanding the capabilities and limitations of language models like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Anthropic's Claude. When we say "the language model knows something", we are using the knowledge-of sense - it has access to information through the data it was trained on, which ultimately comes from text written by humans with genuine knowledge-that and knowledge-by. However, the language model itself does not actually have genuine knowledge-that, because it lacks the grounded experiential understanding that comes from being an embodied agent interacting with the world.

  Language serves as an encoding and transmission mechanism for knowledge-that and knowledge-by between agents with genuine experience and understanding. An artificial language model can display apparent knowledge-that by using patterns extracted from this linguistic data. But underneath, it is operating on a level of mere knowledge-of - it does not actually "know" the meaning of what it is stating in the same way a human does.

  So in summary, while we can somewhat imprecisely say a language model "knows" things in the sense of knowledge-of, it lacks true knowledge-that and certainly lacks knowledge-by. Its knowledge is essentially second-hand, derived from the linguistic representations of other agents describing their real knowledge gained from experience. Appreciating this distinction helps clarify what capabilities language models do and do not possess.
  </draft>


  Improve the tite to be more representative of the importance of the contradiction. Use a more casual tone.

  <draft>
  Here's an updated draft with a revised title and more casual tone:

  Title: Why I Can Say "The AI Knows" but Still Claim "It Doesn't Really Know"?

  We often talk about AI language models like they have real knowledge - "ChatGPT said the capital of France is Paris" or "Claude knows a lot about quantum physics." But then we also say things like "Language models don't actually understand what they're saying" or "They have no real knowledge, just patterns in data."

  This seems like a contradiction, but there's actually a useful philosophical distinction that can resolve it. The philosopher Bertrand Russell drew a line between two types of knowledge:

  _Knowledge-that_ - This is factual, descriptive knowledge that can be stated in propositions or truth claims. Think "book smarts."

  _Knowledge-by_ - This is experiential, first-hand knowledge gained through direct acquaintance or immersion. The "street smarts" version.  

  But there's a third type of knowledge that doesn't quite fit into Russell's framing:

  _Knowledge-of_ - Second-hand knowledge gained indirectly through conveyances like text and conversation rather than genuine experience.

  Language models like Claude have plenty of knowledge-of. Their training process ingrains them with a vast trove of information extracted from the human-written text they were exposed to. So when Claude tells you about the Napoleonic Wars or answers a coding question, it's drawing upon this second-hand knowledge-of.

  Crucially, though, the AI doesn't have the grounded, experiential knowledge-by that a human historian or programmer would have. It also lacks the conceptual, justified true belief that comprises genuine knowledge-that. This lack of knowledge-that, but requirement to generate syntactically correct language, is what leads the model to hallucinate.

  Language serves to encode and transmit knowledge-that and knowledge-by between genuinely knowledgeable agents. But for an AI, it's purely operating on the knowledge-of level - extracting apparent knowlege from linguistic patterns without the underlying semantics.

  So while we can imprecisely say an "AI knows" things in the sense of knowledge-of, it lacks true knowledge-that and certainly knowledge-by. Its knowledge is second-hand, derived from linguistic representations of reality rather than genuine understanding.

  That's why I can honestly claim both "the AI knows" and "it doesn't actually know" without contradicting myself. What it "knows" is mere knowledge-of, not the real thing. Keeping this distinction in mind helps appreciate what capabilities language models do and don't actually possess.
  </draft>

  Create a short, one-paragraph summary for the final draft.

  <summary>
  We often claim AI language models both "know" and "don't actually know" things, which seems contradictory. However, this contradiction can be resolved by recognizing different types of knowledge - factual knowledge-that, experiential knowledge-by, and second-hand knowledge-of gained indirectly through language. While language models like ChatGPT have an abundance of knowledge-of extracted from their training data, they lack the grounded, first-hand knowledge-by that humans possess, as well as the conceptual understanding that constitutes true knowledge-that. Language serves to encode and transmit genuine knowledge between humans, but for an AI, it is operating solely at the level of knowledge-of extracted from linguistic patterns without underlying comprehension. Appreciating this distinction between knowledge types explains how language models can simultaneously "know" things in the sense of knowledge-of while still lacking actual knowledge.
  </summary>

  Make the summary tweet-length and appropriate for social media sharing.

  <summary>
  We say AIs "know" things, yet also claim they "don't actually know." This isn't contradictory - it's about different knowledge types. AIs have knowledge-of from data, but lack humans' genuine knowledge-that (justified true belief) & knowledge-by (direct experience). Key distinction!
