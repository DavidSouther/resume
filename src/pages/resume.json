Our previous platform was a brittle Scala Server Pages implementation. After releasing this rewrite, our slick & fast AngularJS frontend has become decoupled from the Scala backend, allowing both services to become much more focused and performant. We also build and maintain the NVD3 open-source charting library. I have led an ongoing effort to refactor the original prototype codebase into a maintainable, extensible, and testable library that will serve front-end charting for years to come."
