At present, it is difficult or inconvenient for a user to visualize such graphs at varying levels of granularity or hierarchy. Per the techniques of this disclosure, a hull is defined as a node with descendants, and a segment is defined as a bundle of edges between descendants below a pair of nodes. By enabling a user to expand or collapse a hull, and by routing edges via segments connecting parent nodes, the described techniques enable a high-level visualization of large graph networks that can be quickly refocused into low-level pictures.</p></section><section class="pub"><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17149668/is-stat-an-expensive-system-call/17149924#17149924">Is stat() an expensive system call?</a><small> <em>2013-06-01</em></small></p></section><section class="pub"><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12920892/format-date-time-in-angularjs/12921096#12921096">Format Date time in AngularJS</a><small> <em>2012-10-01</em></small></p></section></main></article></div></main><footer class="no-print"><nav><p>© David Souther 2008-<!-- -->2023</p><cite><a href="https://github.com/davidsouther/resume">Page Source</a></cite></nav></footer></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{"posts":[{"id":"behavioral_interviewing","date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00.000Z","show":true,"summary":"Learn how to tell your story in the STAR narrative format.
