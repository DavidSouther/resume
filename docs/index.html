whiteboarding is often encountered in an interview setting, but the techniques 
to solve an interview question apply equally well to a wide range of design and 
development scenarios. This several-part series presents a checklist of steps 
to work through a technical problem, shows a variety of ways to diagram 
programs, and has an extensive glossary of data structures &amp; algorithms topics. 
A section on the &quot;Forward/Backward Method&quot; applies mathematical proof 
techniques to have a systematic approach to DS&amp;A problem solving.</p>

have connections in multiple dimensions. At present, it is difficult or 
inconvenient for a user to visualize such graphs at varying levels of 
granularity or hierarchy. Per the techniques of this disclosure, a hull is 
defined as a node with descendants, and a segment is defined as a bundle of 
edges between descendants below a pair of nodes. By enabling a user to expand 
or collapse a hull, and by routing edges via segments connecting parent nodes, 
the described techniques enable a high-level visualization of large graph 
networks that can be quickly refocused into low-level pictures.</p>
