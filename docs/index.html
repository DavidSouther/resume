                As head of Front End Development at Novus Partners, I lead a
                team of four developers (including myself) in a complete
                front-end rewrite. Our previous platform was a brittle Scala
                Server Pages implementation. After releasing this rewrite, our
                slick &amp; fast AngularJS frontend has become decoupled from
                the Scala backend, allowing both services to become much more
                focused and performant. We also build and maintain the NVD3
                open-source charting library. I have led an ongoing effort to
                refactor the original prototype codebase into a maintainable,
                extensible, and testable library that will serve front-end
                charting for years to come.
