e:Tb31,<p>Why I Can Say &quot;The AI Knows&quot; but Still Claim &quot;It Doesn&#39;t Really Know&quot;?</p>
<p>We often talk about AI language models like they have real knowledge: &quot;ChatGPT said the capital of France is Paris&quot; or &quot;Claude knows a lot about quantum physics.&quot; But then we also say things like &quot;Language models don&#39;t actually understand what they&#39;re saying&quot; or &quot;They have no real knowledge, just patterns in data.&quot;</p>
<p>This seems like a contradiction, but there&#39;s actually a useful philosophical distinction that can resolve it. The philosopher Bertrand Russell drew a line between two types of knowledge:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Knowledge-that</em>: This is factual, descriptive knowledge that can be stated in propositions or truth claims. Think &quot;book smarts.&quot;</li>
<li><em>Knowledge-by</em>: This is experiential, first-hand knowledge gained through direct acquaintance or immersion. The &quot;street smarts&quot; version.</li>
</ul>
<p>But there&#39;s a third type of knowledge that doesn&#39;t quite fit into Russell&#39;s framing:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Knowledge-of</em>: Second-hand knowledge gained indirectly through conveyances like text and conversation rather than genuine experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Language models like Claude have plenty of knowledge-of. Their training process exposes them to a vast trove of information extracted from the human-written text used as training . So when Claude tells you about the Napoleonic Wars or answers a coding question, it&#39;s drawing upon this second-hand knowledge-of.</p>
<p>Crucially, though, the AI doesn&#39;t have the grounded, experiential knowledge-by that a human historian or programmer would have. It also lacks the conceptual, justified true belief that comprises genuine knowledge-that. This lack of knowledge-that, combined with the requirement to generate syntactically correct language, is what leads the model to hallucinate.</p>
<p>Language serves to encode and transmit knowledge-that and knowledge-by between genuinely knowledgeable agents—people like you and me. AI, on the other hand, operates purely on the knowledge-of level--extracting apparent knowledge from linguistic patterns without the underlying semantics.</p>
<p>So while we can imprecisely say an AI“ knows&quot; things in the sense of knowledge-of, it lacks true knowledge-that and certainly lacks knowledge-by. Its knowledge is second-hand, derived from linguistic representations of reality and not genuine understanding.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why I can honestly claim both &quot;the AI knows&quot; and &quot;it doesn&#39;t actually know&quot; without contradicting myself. What it &quot;knows&quot; is mere knowledge-of, not the real thing. Keeping this distinction in mind helps clarify what capabilities language models do and don&#39;t actually possess.</p>
